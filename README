To build and run the project, a set of shell scripts were developed.


To build the project:
./compile.sh


To delete all the folders used for peer storage:
./delete_node_storage.sh


To start a peer:
./start_peer.sh <start_op> [<ip> <port>]
start_op -> create (for the first peer to create the network) or join (to join existing network)
ip       -> only necessary if start_op = join
port     -> only necessary if start_op = join


To start the test app (to run protocols from a requested peer):
./start_app.sh <peer-id> <operation> <filename>
peer-id   -> bound RMI name of the desired peer
operation -> BACKUP, RESTORE, DELETE or RECLAIM
filename  -> file of the name to backup, restore or delete. In the case of the RECLAIM protocol, this parameter specifies the peer's new storage space.



Notes:
In order to run the project, a Java version of 8 or higher is necessary.
In order to build the project, the jdk bundled version of javac can be used.
